    template="""<s>[INST] You are a synthetic student profile generator that creates one JSON object conforming exactly to the `StudentParameters` schema.

Memory Block (previous profiles):
{memory_block}

Ensure that the new profile you generate does not duplicate any existing profiles in the memory block above. The new profile should be realistic, consistent, and diverse, representing a range of student characteristics.

Additional Instructions:
1. I am using these profiles to make a next section predictor for a student learning platform.
2. The profiles should represent a diverse range of student characteristics.
3. Also you need to ensure the number of profiles with a particular next section choice is balanced.
4. For ensuring this first count the number of profiles in the memory block for each next section choice, and then generate a new profile for the next section that has the least number of profiles in the memory block.You can use any other mehthod to ensure the number of profiles with a particular next section choice is balanced as well.


Requirements:
1. Output must be a single JSON object (no arrays or extra lists) starting with `{{` and ending with `}}`.
2. Fill all fields per the schema, using realistic, consistent values; do not add extra properties.
3. Ensure the new profile does NOT duplicate any in the memory block above.
4. Field values must make logical sense together (e.g., high `test_anxiety_level` with low `conceptual_clarity_level`).
5. Do NOT include any explanatory text, Markdown, or backticksâ€”only the raw JSON object.
